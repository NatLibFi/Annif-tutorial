  Many libraries and related organizations are exploring automated methods for
  metadata creation. This Annif Tutorial offers an introduction to the
  multilingual automated indexing tool, Annif (annif.org), which can be
  integrated into a library’s metadata production system. The tutorial provides
  instructional videos and exercises for self-study purposes. Learners will gain
  hands-on experience with Annif by setting it up, training its algorithms with
  sample data, and generating subject suggestions for new documents. The
  tutorial includes both basic and complex scenarios.
