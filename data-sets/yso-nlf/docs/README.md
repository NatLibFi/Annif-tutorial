# Theses from University of Jyv채skyl채

This directory contains a corpus of 2066 English language Master's and
doctoral theses published in the years 2010 to 2017, collected from the
[University of Jyv채skyl채 digital repository JYX](https://jyx2.jyu.fi).

Only the URLs and subject metadata are stored in this Git repository. Actual
PDF documents must be downloaded separately.

## Retrieving the PDFs

You can fetch the PDF files using the Makefile:

    make pdf

This requires the `wget` utility. To download more than one document at a time,
add the `-jN` option, where `N` specifies the number of jobs to run
simultaneously (e.g. `make -j8 pdf` will download 8 documents in parallel).

## Converting the PDFs to text

You can convert the fetched PDF files to text files using the Makefile:

    make txt

This requires the `pdftotext` utility. To convert more than one document at a time,
add the `-jN` option, where `N` specifies the number of jobs to run
simultaneously (e.g. `make -j4 txt` will convert 4 documents in parallel).
