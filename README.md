# Annif tutorial

The tutorial includes *short video presentatios* and *hands-on exercises*, which 
can be explored via [the outline page](exercises/README.md). 
Two example [data sets](data-sets) are provided to be used in the exercises.

The tutorial was initially organized at
[SWIB19](http://swib.org/swib19/programme.html) 
and later updated for 
[DCMI Virtual 2020](http://dublincore.org/conferences/2020/),
but the materials are freely available for self-study.

## Prerequisites

You will need a computer with sufficient resources (at least 8GB RAM) to be
able to install Annif and complete the [exercises](exercises). 
Installation of Annif is one topic of the exercises.

Note also that it might be convenient to have either Docker or VirtualBox
installed beforehand.  Note that when using Docker desktop (Windows), you
might want to increase the available memory for it to 8GB under Settings ->
Advanced.

## Getting the tutorial materials

To complete the exercises of this tutorial, you will need a local copy of the materials,
especially the data sets (unless you use the pre-built VirtualBox VM, which
includes them).  The easiest way to get them is to either clone this
repository or download it as a zip archive from GitHub (click the green "Clone
or download" button).

When you have the files locally, you also need to download the example
full text documents for either or both data sets. The downloads are automated using
`make` - see the README files for both data sets
([yso-nlf](data-sets/yso-nlf), [stw-zbw](data-sets/stw-zbw)) for details.

## Online help sessions

From time to time, we organize online help sessions for people working on the tutorial exercises. To register, you must have watched the videos and at least attempted to complete the exercises. Current schedule:

* [DCMI Virtual post-conference tutorial](https://www.dublincore.org/news/2020/09-11-tutorial-on-automated-subject-indexing-with-annif/)
  * Friday October 9 2020, 07:00-08:30 UTC (registration opens on Friday 25 September)
  * Wednesday October 21 2020, 15:00-16:30 UTC (registration opens on Wednesday 7 September)

The sessions are held remotely using Zoom. In the registration form, you are asked which topics you need help with or want to discuss. The number of participants is capped for practical reasons.
