# Annif tutorial

The tutorial includes short **video presentatios** and **hands-on exercises**, which 
can be explored via [the outline page](exercises/README.md). 
Two example [data sets](data-sets) are provided to be used in the exercises.

The tutorial was initially organized at
[SWIB19](http://swib.org/swib19/programme.html) 
and later updated for 
[DCMI Virtual 2020](http://dublincore.org/conferences/2020/)
and [SWIB22](https://swib.org/swib22/programme.html),
but the materials are freely available for self-study.

## Prerequisites

You will need a computer with sufficient resources (at least 8GB RAM and 20GB free disk space) to be
able to install Annif and complete the [exercises](exercises). Installation of Annif is one topic of the exercises.

Note also that it might be convenient to have either Docker or VirtualBox
installed beforehand.  When using Docker desktop (Windows), you
might want to increase the available memory for it to 8GB under Settings ->
Advanced.

## Getting the tutorial materials

To complete the exercises of this tutorial, you will need a local copy of the materials,
especially the data sets (unless you use the pre-built VirtualBox VM, which
includes them).  The easiest way to get them is to either clone this
repository or download it as a zip archive from GitHub (click the green "Code" button near the top for clone and download options).

When you have the files locally, you also need to download the example
full text documents for either or both data sets. The downloads are automated using
`make` - see the README files for both data sets
([yso-nlf](data-sets/yso-nlf), [stw-zbw](data-sets/stw-zbw)) for details.

## Upcoming help sessions
