Welcome to this Annif tutorial video.
In this setup you will be using GitHub Codespaces.
Annif will be running in a GitHub-hosted machine, which you will access via a terminal in your browser.
For this setup you are required to have an account on GitHub.

Let's configure a New Codespace.
First, click the following badge to on the tutorial web page to go to the configuration of a new codespace.
On the codespace configuration page,
Choose “4-core” for the "Machine type" (from the bottommost menu).
Leave other selections at their default values.
Click the green "Create codespace" button at the bottom of the page.
       
Once you’ve created the codespace, a new session will start in your browser.

Now the codespace is running. 
Annif is already installed there and ready to be used for exercises!
