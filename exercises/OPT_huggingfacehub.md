# Optional exercise: Sharing models via Hugging Face Hub 

The [ðŸ¤— Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) is a company and ecosystem for artificial intelligence applications and their development.
The Hugging Face Hub is a platform similar to GitHub; it hosts git repositories of three types:
- [Datasets](https://huggingface.co/datasets) - for training models
- [Models](https://huggingface.co/models) - ready-to-use models
- [Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) - applications using the models 

Annif's CLI includes commands [`upload`](https://annif.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/commands.html#annif-upload) 
and [`download`](https://annif.readthedocs.io/en/stable/source/commands.html#annif-download) to make it easy to share projects and their associated vocabularies
via Hugging Face Hub model repositories.

Both upload and download commands expect a glob pattern for project IDs as the first argument (for example `"*"` to match all project IDs)
and a Hugging Face Hub repository ID as the second argument (user or organisation name and repository name separated by a slash: `user_or_org/repo`).

## 1. Download Hogwarts project

In the optional [Hogwarts exercise](/exercises/OPT_hogwarts.md) the aim is to train a project using fastText algorithm to implement a Sorting Hat.
Whether you have already completed that exercise or not, you can run perform this exercise; existing projects will not be overwritten.

Run this command to download the project from the Hugging Face Hub repository [NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial](https://huggingface.co/NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial) :

    annif download hogwarts NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial

Note that the repository contains all YSO, 20news, and Hogwarts projects trained in this tutorial (see the ["Files and versions" tab](https://huggingface.co/NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial/tree/main)), and you can download any of them.

## 2. Test the downloaded project

The project and vocabulary data files have been downloaded and placed to `data/` directory and they are ready to be used, but the downloaded project configuration file has been placed in the `projects.d/` directory.
To access the project, you need use the `--projects` option to make Annif to look for the project configuration files from the right place:

    annif list-projects -p projects.d/

Alternatively you could append the configuration from `projects.d/hogwarts.cfg` to `projects.cfg` with the command `cat projects.d/hogwarts.cfg >> projects.cfg`, after which the `-p projects.d/` option is not needed.

You should see the project you downloaded in the listing, and now you can use the `hogwarts` project for suggestions. 
For example, run this command:

    echo "Hugging Face" | annif suggest hogwarts -p projects.d/

## EXTRA: Upload projects
<details><summary>
See details of extra section
</summary>
    
For uploading projects you need to have an account on the Hugging Face Hub; you can create one [here](https://huggingface.co/join).
You also need to be logged in to service, and the repository to upload to needs to exist.

### Create a new model repository 
To create a new model repository you can use [this link](https://huggingface.co/new) 
or navigate to it via your Hugging Face Hub profile (the round profile image in the upper right corner on the HFH website).
Give the repository the name `Annif-tutorial`; the repository can be either private or public.

### Login to Hugging Face Hub
Create a User Access token to your HFH account in [this page](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) with write access.

Use command

    huggingface-cli login

and pass your token when asked for it.
Decline by answering `n` to when asked `Add token as git credential?`.

Alternatively to running `huggingface-cli login` you can pass your User Access token with the `--token` option of the `annif upload` command.

### Upload a project
Upload your TFIDF project, which is small in size and so the upload is fast.

If you use the `yso-nlf` data set, run this command:

    annif upload yso-tfidf-en <your-username>/Annif-tutorial  # --token <your-token>

If you use the `stw-zbw` data set, run this command:

    annif upload stw-tfidf-en <your-username>/Annif-tutorial  # --token <your-token>

To upload all your projects, you could use a glob pattern `"*"` in place of the full project ID
(here the quotation marks around the pattern are necessary to avoid the shell to expand the `*` wildcard to all filenames in your current directory), 
but note that size of the projects can be several gigabytes.

A subset of all projects can be uploaded by entering the common parts of the project IDs and a wildcard, 
e.g. the 20news projects of the [classification exercise](exercises/OPT_classification.md) with

    annif upload 20news-* <your-username>/Annif-tutorial

### Create a model card in your repository
HFH model repositories have `README.md` files that can contain human readable description of the model and some metadata in YAML format, which offers valuable features.

From [Model Cards documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/model-cards)

> The metadata you add to the model card supports discovery and easier use of your model. For example:
>    - Allowing users to filter models at https://huggingface.co/models.
>    - Displaying the modelâ€™s license.
>    - Adding datasets to the metadata will add a message reading Datasets used to train: to your model page and link the relevant datasets, if theyâ€™re available on the Hub.

For example, the [NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial](https://huggingface.co/NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial) repository includes a short textual description and metadata in YAML format.
The metadata is shown on the website under the repository name: the intended task of the model, the dataset used to train the model, the language the model is intended for, some freeform tags and the licence of the model:
