## 4. TFIDF project
The basic functionality of Annif is introduced by setting up and training a project using a TFIDF model.

## 7. [Optional] REST API
In the background the web UI uses the API of Annif, which can be accessed also directly.
- [exercise](/exercises/07_rest_api.md)


## 8. Metrics & evaluation
More quantitative testing and comparison of projects can be done based on metrics given by Annif's evaluation command.

- [exercise](/exercises/04_evaluate.md)

## 9. [Optional] Omikuji project
The evaluation results of the TFIDF project can be compared for example to an Omikuji based project.

## 10. Installing Maui Server
### 10.1. Docker

- [slides]()
- [transcript of video]()

### 10.2.Linux local install

## 12. [Optional] Hogwarts Sorting Hat using fastText
Yet another algorithm you can try is fastText, which can dig into the character level of a text.
- [exercise](/exercises/09_hogwarts.md)

## 13. Ensemble project
An ensemble project combines results from the projects set up in previous exercises.

- [transcript of video]()
- [exercise](/exercises/06_ensemble_project.md)

## 14. [Optional] Neural network ensemble project and incremental learning
Neural network ensemble can be trained to intelligently combine the results from the base projects. NN ensemble is also capable to online incremental learning, i.e. the training can be continued while the model is in use.
