# Exercise 12: Create a custom corpus for Annif (DRAFT)

In this lesson we will look at how to make a corpus to use with Annif.

## 0. Introduction to Annif Corpora and corpora formats (in here or as slides)
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines a corpus as "all the writings or works of a particular kind or on a particular subject" or a "collection or body of knowledge or evidence".
Various corpora are widely used in language and literature research. In this case we use the term to refer to a data collection used to train or evaluate Annif.
Annif supports two document corpus formats: one for full-text or longer documents and another for metadata or very short texts.

### Full-text corpora
All of the documents should be in `.txt`-format. The assigned subjects for each document can be included in a separate file. The subject file has the same file name as the document, but with the
extension `.tsv` or `.key`.  The main distinction between the two is whether or not subject URIs are included. 

A  `.key`-file simply lists subject labels, UTF-8 encoded, one per line. For example:

```
networking
computer science
Internet Protocol
```

Note that the labels must exactly match the preferred labels of concepts in the subject vocabulary.


A  `.tsv`-file is otherwise similar, but the subject file is now a UTF-8 encoded tab separated file, where the first column contains a subject URI within angle brackets `<>` and the second column its label. For example:

```
<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj1>	networking
<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj2>	computer science
<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj3>	Internet Protocol
```

Any additional columns beyond the first two are ignored.

When using this format, subject comparison is performed based on URIs, not the labels. Since URIs are (or should be) more persistent than labels, this ensures that subjects can be matched even if the labels have changed in the subject
vocabulary.

### Short text document corpus 

A document corpus can be given in a single UTF-8 encoded TSV file. This format is especially useful for metadata about documents, when only titles are known, or for very short documents. The first column contains the text of the document (e.g. title or title + abstract) while the second column contains a whitespace-separated list of subject URIs (again within angle brackets) for that document. For example:

```
RFC 791: Internet Protocol	<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj1> <http://example.org/thesaurus/subj3>
RFC 1925: The Twelve Networking Truths	<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj1> <http://example.org/thesaurus/subj2>
Go To Statement Considered Harmful	<http://example.org/thesaurus/subj2>
```

Note that it is also possible to separate the subjects with tabs, thus creating a variable number of columns.

The TSV file may be compressed using gzip compression. The compressed file must have the extension `.gz`. Annif corpora are usually divided into three sets, train, validate and test. The training and testing corpora are used as they are named - the validation set can be used for fine-tuning models.

## 1. Obtain data
In this exercise we will use a corpus of scientific articles retrieved from ArXiv for demonstration purposes. You can use the [Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/NatLibFi/Annif-tutorial/blob/update-spring-2021/data-sets/arxiv/create-arxiv-corpus.ipynb) to construct the subject vocabulary and the corpus. 
Once you have installed Jupyter (we provide / include it), type `jupyter notebook` on the command line and navigate to the notebook in the browser window that opens. Run the notebook step-by-step by e.g. pressing `shift+enter` in every interactive block. Read also the notebook comments.

## 2. Use the corpus with Annif
Try training Annif with the ArXiv corpora and evaluate the result.
